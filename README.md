# Round-Reaction
MVP lab project in WFA C#

Thame is made with graphics. The rules are simple, put your cursor where there is no other ball and press "space" or "click" and the game will start.
The objective is to avoid the other balls and try and hold as long as you can. There is a timer that will show you when the game is over how much you have lasted.
